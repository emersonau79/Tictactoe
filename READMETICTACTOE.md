This is a game where there are two players who use "X" and "O"s to mark their spot in a 3x3 grid 
the first person to get all three of their letter in a row wins the game 
You can win by diagnol, rows and/or columns 
the program works by printing a 3x3 grid where player 1 and 2 get get to mark x or o into a spot until the grid is full or if one of the players win
